This is a chess game created by Dr.Sustancia.
The main idea with this is app is to explore the possibilities of the min-max algorithm.
Using the UI of chessboard npm and the rules of chessjs, we can focus on our main task here:
provide an algorithm to calculate the best possible move.
// Comment about the idea of getting all chess matches in databases and search
(It's a hell if you think in performance)

TODO:

-get list of chess databases
-check the APIs availables
-check the number of records of chess games
-Analyse the impact of a look up over that N of records once the algorithm is already set
-Mutate the algorithm
-Mutate
-Mutate always


About minmax Alg:

Minimax (sometimes MinMax or MM[1]) is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"â€”to maximize the minimum gain. Originally formulated for two-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.
